## Basic information:

This routine is based on the raspberrypi development with kernel version:

**Linux raspberrypi 5.4.51-v7l+ #1333 SMP Mon Aug 10 16:51:40 BST 2020 armv7l GNU/Linux**

You can view the detailed test routine in the project's main.py

## Pin connections:

Pin connections can be viewed in config.py, which is repeated here:
- EPD    =>    Jetson Nano/RPI(BCM)
- VCC    ->    Without direct connection, other devices can be directly connected to 3.3V
- GND    ->    GND
- DIN    ->    10(MOSI)
- DOUT   ->    9(MISO)
- SCLK   ->    11(SCLK)
- CS     ->    22
- DRDY   ->    17
- REST   ->    18
- AVDD   ->    5V or 2.5V
- AVSS   ->    GND or -2.5V

## 1. Install Requirements

**Python 2**

'''
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install python-pil
    sudo apt-get install python-numpy
    sudo pip2 install Jetson.GPIO
	sudo pip2 install spidev
'''

or

**Python 3**

'''
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install python3-pil
    sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
    sudo pip3 install Jetson.GPIO
	sudo pip3 install spidev
''' 

## 2. Open SPIï¼š

1. Run this command for to setup SPI cabilities for the GPIO pins. 

'''
	sudo /opt/nvidia/jetson-io/jetson-io.py
'''

2. The GPIO Tools menu will pop up, select "Configure 40-Pin Expansion Header" and press Enter.

3. Tick SPI1 and return to the higher menu 

4. Finally select "Save and Reboot to Reconfigure Pins" to make the device reboot configuration take effect.

**Setup is complete!**

## Basic use:
The factory hardware default COM has been connected to GND

The program has configured IN0 and IN1 two analog output

At this time you can draw IN0 or IN1 and GND to measure the target voltage

Input:

'''
	sudo python sipm.py
'''

or

'''
	sudo python3 sipm.py
'''
  
## Plese Note 

You might need to run `sudo modprobe spidev` in the terminal every time you restart the Jetson due to the spidev module having issues locating on the Jetson. This solution was found online and appears to be a very common issue on Jetson if you need more infomation about it.

Please run in python3, older versions of python might not work with the above sudo command.
